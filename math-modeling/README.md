# Realization of several mathematical models
Realization of several mathematical models from book "Principles of Mathematical Modelling: Ideas, Methods, Examples" authorship of Alexander A. Samarskii, Alexander P. Mikhailov.
1. Measuring Bullet Velocity - horizontal shooting, shooting boxes with sand (the law of conservation of energy) and shooting boxes with sand (the law of conservation of momentum & energy)
2. Rocket Science Problems - single-stage and multi-stage rocket types
3. Ballistic Missile Defense - simulation of missile movement, telemetry of the enemy missile trajectory and the destruction of missiles and enemy bases with anti-missiles
4. Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) - solving first order ODEs and second order ODEs, solving a system of ODEs
5. Predator-Prey - simulation of "Predator-Prey" system, also with a saturation effect
6. Arms Race - simulation of an arms race between two countries, also with the dependence of coefficients on time
